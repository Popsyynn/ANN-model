# ANN-model
The goal of this project was to predict the outcome if a customer had exited the organization or not ,using an artificial neural network (ANN) model.  The ANN model used in this project consists of 4 layers , 2 of which comprises the hidden layers , with the Input layer and output layer corresponding to the other 2.  From the dataset , The Row number , Customer ID and Surname columns uniquely Identifies each customers , since these columns are not important input features they are dropped from the dataframe leaving only the important features to train the model with.  I initialized the ANN model by importing and calling the Sequential model and then proceeded to creating the layers of the ANN model.  The summary of the ANN model is given in Line 23 , the model was trained for 100 epochs and an accuracy of 86.73% was achieved  With this trained model , We can make predictions on the test set and we can also validate the model using some validation sets.
